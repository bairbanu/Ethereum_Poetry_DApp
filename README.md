# Ethereum Poetry DApp with React & Redux Frontend.

A decentralized fullstack Ethereum application showcasing some of Zubair Ahmed's poetry. Uses IPFS for decentralized storage, Ethereum Ropsten Testnet for smart contract storage, and React/Redux for frontend UI/UX. Will also be deployed to Github Pages so application can be experienced without lag (IPFS is still a nascent technology).
